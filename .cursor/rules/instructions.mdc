**Project: Confluence Zen Mode Chrome Extension**

1. **What we're building:**
   Create a Chrome browser extension that provides a distraction-free "zen mode" for Confluence pages by hiding UI elements like menus, toolbars, sidebars, and other interface clutter, leaving only the main content editor visible and nothing else.

2. **Why we're building it:**
   To improve focus and productivity when writing or editing content in Confluence by removing visual distractions, creating a cleaner workspace that emphasizes just the content being worked on.

3. **Development guidelines:**
   - Follow Chrome extension best practices and manifest v3 standards
   - Implement clean, maintainable JavaScript using modern patterns
   - Create toggleable functionality so users can switch between zen mode and normal mode
   - Ensure the extension works reliably across different Confluence instances
   - Handle Confluence updates gracefully by using resilient CSS selectors
   - Consider performance impact and optimize accordingly.
